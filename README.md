## Description

 A README file is the first thing that a person sees when they visit a repo on GitHub. This project generates a professional readme file. I built this project to get familiar with how markdown files work, how licenses and badges work, how to use the npm package inquirer, and how nodeJS creates text files. I can now use this tool to quickly create a professional readme for my future projects.
